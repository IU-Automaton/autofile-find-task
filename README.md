## Introduction

A more detailed description of what the task does. Avoid having code in here, unless necessary.


## Requirements

If your task requires something from the environment in which it runs that can't be guaranteed through `package.json`, you should mention it here, and give directions on how to get those installed (linking to another *"how to install"* is fine).


## Usage

A concise description of how to use the task. If the task can accomplish a lot, consider breaking this section into several subsections, each incrementing on the previous, possibly with multiple examples.

### Options

A list of the options that the task can get, and what they are for:

- `option1`: This is option1!
- `another_option`: This is another option.

### Example

```
